# Sasply version 0.0.6 - Beta 

Sasply means still a simple player.

a simple player written in JavaFX with playlist support.

You can play your favorite songs and salve personal playlist to play them after. 
It is supporting lyrics, but I will improve this feature.

This project is continuous. I will want to implement other features as play videos and streaming.

Supported song format:
                       mp3 and m4a
